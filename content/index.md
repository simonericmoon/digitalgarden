title: Welcome to my Digital Garden!
---
I will use this digital garden to sort notes for stuff I learn, create a second brain, publish articles and write about stuff that interests me or I want to tdeal with in some shape or form currently; so: coding, ai, rust, robotics, geoinformatics, art, WH40k. 

This is a blank Quartz installation.
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.
